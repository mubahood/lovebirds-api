# Complete Multimedia Messaging Rules & Requirements

## üìã COMPREHENSIVE RULE SET FROM USER

Based on all instructions provided throughout the conversation, here are **each and every rule** about multimedia messaging:

---

## üö´ CRITICAL RULE #1: NO LOCAL FILE PATHS
**Rule**: Never accept or process local file paths from mobile app
**Example Given**: 
```
‚ùå WRONG: /data/user/0/Lovebirds Dating.com/code_cache/audio_1754345517765.m4a
‚úÖ RIGHT: Actual file upload via multipart/form-data
```
**Explanation**: User was seeing local file paths in production and explicitly stated "this is a local file path! you have not followed my rules please...." The backend must only accept actual uploaded files, never file path strings.

---

## üîß RULE #2: USE EXISTING UPLOAD METHOD
**Rule**: Must use `Utils::upload_images_2()` method for file uploads
**Example Given**:
```php
$images = Utils::upload_images_2($_FILES, false);
```
**Explanation**: User specifically instructed to use this existing method instead of creating new file upload functions. Must use single file mode: `Utils::upload_images_2([$_FILES['photo']], true)`

---

## üì± RULE #3: USE IMAGE_PICKER PACKAGE
**Rule**: Must use `image_picker` package for Flutter media selection
**Package Specification**: `image_picker: ^1.0.4`
**Explanation**: User explicitly stated "use this package packages/image_picker to pic image from camera or photo" and later reinforced "I also told you to use this flutter package for picking images or videos or camera (image_picker) , you must use that"

---

## üéØ RULE #4: REMOVE GALLERY, USE CAMERA + PHOTO
**Rule**: Remove gallery option, replace with separate camera and photo options
**Implementation Required**:
- Camera option: `ImageSource.camera`
- Photo library option: `ImageSource.gallery` 
**Explanation**: User wanted to eliminate generic "gallery" in favor of specific "camera" and "photo library" options for better UX

---

## üìÅ RULE #5: SINGLE FILE UPLOADS ONLY
**Rule**: Handle only single file uploading, not multiple files
**Implementation**: `is_single_file = true` parameter
**Explanation**: User specified "for now, handle only single file uploading..." to keep the implementation focused and manageable

---

## üíæ RULE #6: STORAGE LOCATION REQUIREMENTS
**Rule**: Save all files in `public/storage/images/` directory
**Quote**: "save all kind of files in public/storage/images/ ... not need to create sub folders or anyhthiong... all fles should be uoloaded there"
**Explanation**: No subdirectories, all multimedia files (photos, videos, audio, documents) go to the same location for simplicity

---

## üëÅÔ∏è RULE #7: PREVIEW BEFORE SENDING
**Rule**: Add logic to preview multimedia before actually sending
**Implementation Required**: Two-step process:
1. Upload file for preview
2. Show preview to user with caption option
3. User confirms and sends
**Explanation**: User wanted users to be able to review their media before committing to send it

---

## üîí RULE #8: CAREFUL FILE HANDLING
**Rule**: Submit multimedia files "very carefully knowing how it is multi media"
**Implementation**: Proper validation, error handling, and security measures
**Explanation**: User emphasized the importance of handling multimedia with proper care and validation

---

## üìä RULE #9: MULTIMEDIA MESSAGE TYPES
**Rule**: Support these specific message types:
- `photo` - Image files (jpg, png, gif, etc.)
- `video` - Video files (mp4, mov, etc.) 
- `audio` - Audio files (mp3, m4a, wav, etc.)
- `document` - Documents (pdf, doc, txt, etc.)
- `text` - Text messages
- `location` - Location sharing
**Explanation**: These are the core message types that must be supported in the chat system

---

## üîÑ RULE #10: BACKEND COMPATIBILITY
**Rule**: "MAKE SURE THE BACKEND WORKS PERFECTLY WITH FRONT END FOR THIS!"
**Implementation**: Seamless API integration between Flutter app and Laravel backend
**Explanation**: User emphasized that backend and frontend must work together flawlessly

---

## üì§ RULE #11: MULTIPART FORM DATA
**Rule**: Use `multipart/form-data` content type for file uploads
**Implementation**:
```dart
var request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', uri);
request.files.add(await http.MultipartFile.fromPath('photo', file.path));
```
**Explanation**: Required for proper file upload handling instead of sending file paths

---

## üèóÔ∏è RULE #12: PROPER API STRUCTURE
**Rule**: Implement proper API endpoints for multimedia handling
**Required Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/upload_media_preview` - Upload file for preview
- `POST /api/chat_send` - Send message with media
**Parameters**:
- `conversation_id`: Chat identifier
- `message_type`: Type of message (photo/video/audio/document)
- `preview_file_name`: File from preview upload
- `content`: Optional caption/message text

---

## üõ°Ô∏è RULE #13: FILE VALIDATION
**Rule**: Validate files by type and size
**Implementation**: Check file extensions, MIME types, and file sizes
**Explanation**: Security measure to prevent malicious file uploads

---

## üî¢ RULE #14: UNIQUE FILE NAMING
**Rule**: Generate unique filenames to prevent conflicts
**Implementation**: Use timestamp + random number + extension
**Example**: `1754345463_8580.mp3`
**Explanation**: Prevents file overwrites and directory traversal attacks

---

## üìã RULE #15: METADATA HANDLING
**Rule**: Capture and store file metadata
**Required Metadata**:
- File size (`media_size`)
- Duration for audio/video (`media_duration`) 
- Thumbnail for images/videos (`media_thumbnail`)
- Original filename
**Explanation**: Needed for proper display and functionality in chat

---

## üîÑ RULE #16: BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
**Rule**: Maintain fallback support for existing implementations
**Implementation**: Support both preview workflow and direct upload
**Explanation**: Don't break existing functionality while adding new features

---

## ‚ö° RULE #17: ERROR HANDLING
**Rule**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the process
**Required Error Cases**:
- File upload failures
- Invalid file types
- File size limits
- Network errors
- Permission errors
**Explanation**: Provide clear feedback to users when things go wrong

---

## üì± RULE #18: MOBILE APP REQUIREMENTS
**Rule**: Specific Flutter implementation requirements
**Dependencies Required**:
```yaml
image_picker: ^1.0.4      # Media selection
video_player: ^2.7.2      # Video preview
audioplayers: ^5.2.1      # Audio preview
file_picker: ^6.1.1       # Document selection
